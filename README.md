# binancemancy
This is Gabriel's repo for component files of the binance automated trading platform. There are master executables that include utilities for setting market orders, limit orders, pulling open positions, and soon setting stop losses.
## TODO
What I need to do is split all of the utilities into different files so that they can be called from the server files and interface with each other upon different algorithmic triggers.
